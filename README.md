# ai-assist-platform

I want to create an AI-powered application development platform that enables the creation, scaling, and documentation of applications using natural language instructions. This project I would like to be selfhosted and licencing free for deployment on low cost serer. This platform should leverage OpenAI and Google Gemini AI models to:

Understand natural language input: Interpret user requests and translate them into actionable tasks for application development.
Generate code and application structure: Automatically create code, project structure, and configuration files based on user input.
Research and integrate alternatives: Evaluate existing solutions and libraries, and incorporate them into the application where appropriate.
Deploy and test: Automate the deployment and testing process, ensuring the application functions correctly in different environments.
Scale dynamically: Adapt the application's infrastructure to handle varying workloads and user demands.
Generate comprehensive documentation: Automatically create detailed project documentation that accurately reflects the application's features, architecture, and usage.
Additional Considerations:

User interface: A user-friendly interface (CLI or web-based) for interacting with the platform and providing instructions.
Customization: Allow users to tailor the application's behavior and output through configuration options or additional prompts.
Security: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
Collaboration: Enable multiple users to collaborate on projects within the platform.
Version control: Integrate with version control systems like Git to track changes and manage different versions of the application.
Error handling and debugging: Provide mechanisms for identifying and resolving errors during development and deployment.
Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD): Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying new versions of the application.
Open-source Technologies to Consider:

AI models: OpenAI (GPT-4, Codex), Google Gemini
Code generation: GPT-Engineer, AutoGPT
Deployment and scaling: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
Documentation: Docusaurus, MkDocs
Automation: node-red, n8n
By combining these tools and technologies, it's possible to create a powerful platform that significantly streamlines the application development process and empowers users to create sophisticated applications without extensive programming knowledge.

## Collaborate with GPT Engineer

This is a [gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app)-synced repository ðŸŒŸðŸ¤–

Changes made via gptengineer.app will be committed to this repo.

If you clone this repo and push changes, you will have them reflected in the GPT Engineer UI.

## Tech stack

This project is built with React and Chakra UI.

- Vite
- React
- Chakra UI

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GPT-Engineer-App/ai-assist-platform.git
cd ai-assist-platform
npm i
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will run a dev server with auto reloading and an instant preview.

## Requirements
